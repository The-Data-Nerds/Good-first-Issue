---

### Step 1️⃣: Fork This Repository

**What is forking?**
Creating your own copy of this project in your GitHub account.

* Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right of this page.
* Wait a few seconds while GitHub creates your copy.

✅ **Success Check:**
You should now be on `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue`

---

### Step 2️⃣: Clone Your Fork

**What is cloning?**
Downloading the code to your computer so you can edit it.

* On **your forked repository**, click the green **"Code"** button.
* Copy the URL (should look like: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue.git`).
* Open your terminal/command prompt.
* Navigate to where you want to save the project (e.g., Desktop):

```bash
  cd Desktop

```

* Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue.git

```

* Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
  cd Good-first-Issue

```

✅ **Success Check:**
Run `ls` (Mac/Linux) or `dir` (Windows). You should see files like `README.md`.

---

### Step 3️⃣: Create a New Branch

**What is a branch?**
A separate version of the code where you can make changes safely.

```bash
git checkout -b add-your-name

```

💡 **Pro Tip:**
Replace `your-name` with your actual name (e.g., `add-john-doe`).

✅ **Success Check:**
You should see: `Switched to a new branch 'add-your-name'`

---

### Step 4️⃣: Add Your Name

* Open `README.md` in your text editor.
* Scroll down to the **"👥 Contributors"** section.
* Add your name following this **exact format**:

```markdown
  - [Aditya Singh Rathore](https://github.com/Adez017)

```

**Example:**

```markdown
- [John Doe](https://github.com/johndoe)

```

* Save the file (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`).

⚠️ **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

* Don't forget the `-` at the start.
* Don't forget the square brackets `[]` around your name.
* Don't forget the parentheses `()` around your GitHub URL.
* Make sure the URL is YOUR GitHub profile (replace `YOUR-USERNAME`).

---

### Step 5️⃣: Commit Your Changes

**What is a commit?**
Saving your changes with a description of what you did.

* Check what you changed:

```bash
  git status

```

You should see `README.md` listed in red.

* Stage your changes:

```bash
  git add README.md

```

* Commit with a message:

```bash
  git commit -m "Add [Your Name] to contributors list"

```

**Example:**

```bash
git commit -m "Add John Doe to contributors list"

```

✅ **Success Check:**
You should see a message like `1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`

---

### Step 6️⃣: Push to GitHub

**What is pushing?**
Uploading your changes from your computer back to GitHub.

```bash
git push origin add-your-name

```

*Remember to use the branch name you created in Step 3!*

✅ **Success Check:**
You should see `Branch 'add-your-name' set up to track remote branch`.

---

### Step 7️⃣: Create a Pull Request

**What is a Pull Request (PR)?**
Asking the project maintainer to review and accept your changes.

* Go to your forked repository on GitHub (`github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Good-first-Issue`).
* You should see a yellow banner saying **"Compare & pull request"** - click it!
* Add a title: `Add [Your Name] to contributors`
* Add a description (optional but nice):

```text
  Hi! This is my first contribution to open source.
  I've added my name to the contributors list.
  Thank you for this beginner-friendly project! 🎉

```

* Click **"Create pull request"**.

✅ **Success Check:**
You should see your PR with a number (e.g., `#42`).

## 🆘 Stuck?

**Error: Git not found or command not recognized**
→ [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and restart your terminal.

**Error: Permission denied when pushing**
→ Make sure you forked the repo and cloned YOUR fork, not the original repository path.

**Error: Merge conflict in Pull Request**
→ Someone else added their name in the same spot. Don't panic!

* Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
* Fix the conflicts in `README.md` (remove the `<<<<`, `====`, `>>>>` markers).
* Add and commit: `git add README.md && git commit -m "Fix merge conflict"`
* Push again: `git push origin add-your-name`

**Need more help?**
→ Check `README.md` for detailed step-by-step instructions
→ See `FAQ.md` for common questions
→ [Open an issue](../../issues) if you're still stuck
